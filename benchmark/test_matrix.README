This is the test we have been using for serverless dask.
There are 2 different tests: shuffle and aggregate

This code is originally written by Sam Ginsburg and Charles Lin,
interns at MSR in 2020.

Some modifications by Rodrigo Fonseca.

The _vanilla version can run on vanilla dask.
The other version requires an instrumented dask for timing info.

The size of the test is controlled by two parameters: par and mem
mem is the largest amount of memory for each worker, and par is the
number of partitions.

Most initial results were done with shuffle, par=4, and varying
memory from 128 to 2048 (MB) per node.
